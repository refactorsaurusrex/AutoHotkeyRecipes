# AutoHotkeyRecipes
My collection of AutoHotkey scripts. 

## CloseExplorerWithEscape

Allows Windows Explorer windows to be closed with the `Esc` key, instead of `Alt + F4`. (Pressing `Esc` to cancel a file or folder rename still works as expected.)

## InsertDate

- Replaces `!today` and `!yesterday` with their respective date values in the format of `4/25/2019`.
- Replaces `@today` and `@yesterday` with their respective date values in the format of `Sunday April 25, 2019`.

## RunAll

As the name implies, this script simply runs all other scripts as one so you only have a single system tray icon rather than (potentially) many.
